# Maps

This repository holds the code for the
[https://gamemaster.pixelastic.com/maps/][1] website. The website is generated
by [norska][2], with the [search-infinite][3] theme.

The data is crawled daily from reddit using [reddinx][4], then pushed to
[Algolia][5]. The code of that part is available on the [maps-data][6]
repository.
